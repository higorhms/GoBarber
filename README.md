## üí• Gobarber | Gostack 11

An updated version of GoBarber with changes ranging from layout to the technologies used. The application continues with the same concept as the previous version, allowing to manage administrator users, clients, schedules, and other features in a barber shop environment.

In this version, architecture standards and good programming practices such as **DDD**, **SOLID**, **Service Pattern**, and **Repository Pattern** were applied. **TDD** was used throughout the development with the tool *Jest*.

> Initially we need to clone the repository to have access to all folders
```bash
  # Cloning repository
  git clone https://github.com/higorhms/GoBarber.git
```

## üíª Instructions for Back End

  We will start by creating instances of our databases. For this project, docker was used. Below are the commands to create the containers and start the instances:

  ```bash
    docker run --name database -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

    docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d -t mongo

    docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d -t redis:alpine

    docker start database mongodb redis
  ```

  First, you will need to create a file containing the access information to your database. This application was developed using **Postgres** and **MongoDB**. Create a file called *ormconfig.json* in the `backend` folder and fill it out according to the model file *ormconfig.example.json*. Remember, before running migrations, to create the database and report the name of your base in the *ormconfig.json* file.
  
  ```bash
    cd backend

    yarn

    yarn typeorm migration:run

    yarn dev:server
  ```

  It will also be necessary to create a .env file, which will contain the environment variables. Use .env.example as a template.

## üíª Instructions for Front End
 
  After executing the previous step and ensuring that the backend is running, you can start the front end:

  ```bash
	cd frontend

  	yarn

  	yarn start
  ```

## üêû Running Tests

  ```bash
    cd backend

    yarn test
  ```
